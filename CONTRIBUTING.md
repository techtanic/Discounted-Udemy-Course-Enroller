# Contributing to the project

I am happy to receive issues describing bug reports and feature requests! If your bug report relates to a security vulnerability, please do not file a public issue, and please instead reach out to me. I do not accept (and do not wish to receive) contributions of user-created or third-party code, including patches, pull requests, or code snippets incorporated into submitted issues. Please do not send me any such code!

If you have a feature request, please describe the feature you would like to see, and why you think it would be useful. I am always interested in hearing about new ideas for the project.

If you have a bug report, please describe the issue you are experiencing, and provide as much detail as possible. If you can provide a minimal example that reproduces the issue, that is even better! I will do my best to address the issue as quickly as possible.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project! I appreciate your help in making the project better for everyone.
